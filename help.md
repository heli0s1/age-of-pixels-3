# How to use

It's a *lot* easier than you think you make this work and install it. 
 * Download the 'uiminimappanelnewmin' xml file from this repo.
 * Put the file on your desktop or wherever you'd like.
 * Go to Steam and right click AOE3, go to 'Properties' and click 'File Location'.
 * Click 'bin', then proceed to 'Data'.
 * Put the file in the /data/ folder for AOE3.
 
In-game Settings:
 * Go to settings while in-game and select 'Minimize UI'.
 
From there, it should work as intended.
