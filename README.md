# Game #01 - AE3
 An in-game overlay that allows for spawning of the following:
* Units
  * All units across the game can be spawned in, regardless of Civilization.
* Resources
  * Low on Wood? Don't worry. You can just spawn that in.
* 'Cheated' Content
  * Things such as Ice Cream Trucks, Superheroes and other cheat content in the main-game.
* Population
  * Need more room? Easily increase that.
 
 This also contains an Out-of-Sync feature as well as a Map Reveal.

 All dropdown menus support Item IDs upto 300, this seemed reasonable but it's easily modifiable by simply adding more in the file. The numbers on the left side of the unit name represents where it'll spawn in accordance to the Item ID you've selected. It'll automatically tell you at the top what you've clicked, though there are some bugs when spawning at mines where only some will spawn there and the rest at the TC. 
 
 The map hack will reveal everything to everyone on your team, so if you are looking to be safe, I suggest either playing with people who are aware you're cheating or only using it in 1v1's. It is also suggested you have the Complete Edition of the game.
