 An in-game overlay that allows for the following:
* Units
  * All units across the game can be spawned in, regardless of Civilization.
* Resources
  * Low on Wood? Don't worry. You can just spawn that in.
* 'Cheated' Content
  * Things such as Ice Cream Trucks, Superheroes and other cheat content in the main-game.
* Population
  * Need more room? Easily increase that.
* Out of Sync
  * Why admit defeat and ruin your stats when you can just crash the game?
* Map Revealer
  * View the enemies every movement. Works just like the spy tool in the Church.

  The map hack will *reveal everything to everyone on your team*, so if you are looking to be safe, I suggest either playing with people who are aware you're cheating or only using it in 1v1's. It is also suggested you have the Complete Edition of the game.
  
 **Bugs:**
  * Units spawned at mines may scatter between the mine and the TC.
  * OOS sometimes becomes unresponsive.
